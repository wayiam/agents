## Description
Agentsdk is a full-stack application that consists of a frontend built with React and a backend powered by Node.js. This project serves as a template for developing applications that require both client-side and server-side functionality.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into two main directories: `frontend` and `backend`.

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Source Code**: Located in the `src` directory
- **Static Assets**: Located in the `public` directory

### Backend
- **Framework**: Node.js
- **Server Setup**: Defined in `server.js`
- **Environment Variables**: Managed through the `.env` file

## Installation Instructions

### Frontend
1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
   ```
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

### Backend
1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:
   ```
   cd backend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the server:
   ```
   node server.js
   ```

## Usage
